			<h2>Giraffe</h2>

			<p class="giraffestext">Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</p>

			<h3>Behavior</h3>

			<p>Typically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.</p>

			<p>Bulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.</p>

			<h3>Height and Size</h3>

			<p>Giraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.</p>

			<h2> Dog Facts</h2>
			<p>We all know dogs have been ‘man’s best friend’ for thousands of years, but there’s loads more to our four-legged friends which makes them really amazing.

				We’ve put together some of our favourite canine facts so you can learn a little more about your pooch.
				<ul>
					<li>Their sense of smell is at least 40x better than ours </li>
					<img src="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/9570/buster.jpg"

					<p> The area of cells in the brain that detect different smells is around 40 times larger in dogs than humans. This means that your dog can pick up on way more smells than we ever could. This is why dogs are often used to sniff out people, drugs and even money!</p>
					<li>Some have such good noses they can sniff out medical problems </li>
					
					<img src="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/9571/medical-detection-dog-pal.jpg"

					<p> Yup, medical detection dogs are a thing. Because their sense of smell is so great, some dogs can be trained to sniff out medical conditions. They are used to diagnose a particular condition or to alert their owners if they need more medication. Some are even being trained to sniff out Covid-19!</p>

					<li>Dogs can sniff at the same time as breathing </li>
					<img src="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/9572/dog-sniffing.jpg"

					<p>
						Dogs rely a lot on their sense of smell to find food, potential dangers, and friends, so needless to say they sniff a lot. Their noses are designed so smells can stay in their nose while air can move in and out of their lungs at the same time, which means they can breathe freely and still work out what that smell is!
